I")	<p>I am a senior IT professional with 20 years’ experience in the sector, with strong leadership, commercial, strategic, sales, project management, and technical skills. I have a successful track record in developing and managing professional, managed and support services practices, from leading teams to commercially negotiating consulting and support engagements, to delivering a whole range of enterprise-grade projects including infrastructure implementation projects, ICT strategy development projects, software &amp; ERP implementation &amp; development projects, and formal testing projects. I have a strong understanding of the strategic planning &amp; financial aspects of projects and service delivery, having managed a number of P&amp;Ls over the years, and I believe I have strong business acumen. I believe I have consistently demonstrated good judgement in the team members I recruited into my teams and have successfully retained key staff.</p>

<p>Services businesses are very much people-oriented businesses and the leader needs to have excellent communication and people management skills, as well as eliciting strong levels of respect from his or her team members from junior levels to senior levels – I believe I have the requisite leadership skills to consistently achieve results in a services context. I have developed a balance between the hard technical expertise required by the IT sector, and the softer skills of communication, project management, people management &amp; strategic understanding, all of which are vital to the successful delivery of any service or project. I have strong numerical analytical skills and can slice and dice data sets to gain valuable business insights into revenue, cost and profitability of services-based businesses. I also have extensive experience of using a variety of industry standard structured project management, service delivery management and software development methodologies.</p>

<p>I have a solid academic background with a Masters Degree in Computer Science, a First Class Honours degree in Business from Trinity College Dublin, a Post-Graduate Diploma in Project Management as well as a range of other qualifications. In 2013 I completed 2 years of study and 7 exams (all passed first time) to become a fully certified ITIL Expert in IT Service Management.</p>
