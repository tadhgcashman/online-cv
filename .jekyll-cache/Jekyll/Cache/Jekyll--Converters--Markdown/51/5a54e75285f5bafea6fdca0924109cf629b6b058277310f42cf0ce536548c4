I"+<p>I currently run the Infrastructure Services Division for Logicalis in Ireland with responsibility for managing all aspects of the development of this practice, which has a team of 25 - 2014 results: revenue circa €3.5m, net profit circa €650k. My Division is divided into 3 functions: Professional Services, Support &amp; Maintenance Services, and Managed Services. While I was originally hired to just develop the professional services practice, I was instrumental in growing the infrastructure support and maintenance services business in Logicalis and I was asked to take over leadership of the support structure within the business and combine it into a single Infrastructure Services practice. Strategically, 2015 is about investing in developing our infrastructure managed service capability. Overall, the role involves recruiting and leading a team of consultants and support specialists to deliver best practice technology consulting and support services to the company’s clients, leading and motivating the sales team to deliver the new projects &amp; contracts to the consulting and support teams, ensuring we are exceeding our clients’ expectations on all projects and services we deliver for them, carrying out strategic consulting assignments for our key clients, managing the support team to deliver on our SLA commitments, and generally managing all strategic and commercial aspects of the development of the Services practice in Logicalis. I am paid on the achievement of revenue and profitability targets, as well as a small number of other KPIs.</p>
